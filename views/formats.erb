<h1> Request formats</h1>
<p>
  So far you've been looking at html pages. This stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language".
  99% of what humans see on the web is html pages.
  This is what we use to convey information in a relatively pretty and human readable format.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this isn't the only format that is used to communicate between your
  browser and the server, as well as between servers.
  In order to communicate what format you want to receive you need to set the 'Accept' header
  to the appropriate type.
  Below are some different examples of formats used.
  Why don't you try checking them out by manually setting your 'Accept' header using
  a tool like Postman, curl, or wget.
  When you're done looking around look in the JSON payload for instructions to the next step.

<table border="1">
<tr>
  <th>Format</th>
  <th>Header</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>JSON</td>
  <td>application/json</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>XML</td>
  <td>application/xml</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>HTML</td>
  <td>text/html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>SOAP</td>
  <td>application/soap+xml</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Plain Text</td>
  <td>text</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p> If you're having issues try this command: 'curl -H "Accept: application/json" <%= request.url %>'
