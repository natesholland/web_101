# Web 101 App

The purpose of this app is to be used in a training session to teach the very basics
of web development and how the internet works.
I'm developing this for use with the new interns at [Spiceworks](https://www.spiceworks.com).
If you want to use this in your company please feel free to take it and adapt it
to fit your training needs.

## Running the application

This application is easy to run. Install the latest version of ruby and run `bundle install` then `ruby web_101.rb`
and the server will boot up and listen on localhost:4567.
This app has no external dependencies so it should be easy to get deployed to any
platform.
